“Thanks for coming in,” says CEO Homer when you head over to his corner of the open office.
Homer is using a stone to sharpen the blade of what he told you is a “tactical tomahawk”.
Without looking up, he says, “Hammer told me your concerns about having the word ‘Recursive’ in our flagship product name if the product cannot even be used to document itself.”

You swallow hard.
Sparks emit from the sharpening stone, the scrape of which sends chills through you.

“I slept on the matter, and I've decided to take it out,” Homer says, much to your relief.
I'm asking the Board at our next meeting, but I think for now, you can change any documentation to reflect that.”

“Sure thing,” you say, relieved.
“So I'll remove the word _Recursive_ and the __R__ in CRE -- in CEPEE -- Ceepee_?”

“Oh, no, that sounds terrible,” Homer says.
You sigh gratefully, until he follows with, “Keep the _R_.”

“You want ‘Recursive’ back in?”

“No, no, just the _R_.”

“You want just the _R_ there, like a placeholder?”

“Sure,” says Homer.
“That gives me an idea.
Let me talk to the Board and get back to you. on it.

“For now,” Homer says, “I wanted to tell you we've got a new Senior Lead Engineer IC-4R starting this afternoon.”

“That's excellent.
I look forward to meeting…”

“Joy Shafar,” Homer said.
“During her interview, Joy mentioned something called Git a lot.
Maybe we should practice up on this Git, so we don't look like a bunch of fools when Joy shows up tomorrow.”

“How about we create a Git repo for the project, and we commit our README to it?” you offer.
