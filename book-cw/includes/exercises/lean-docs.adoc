.The Lean README
****
“Boy did the Board love those Ascii Docs.
They really think Ascii Docs are the wave of the future!”
It takes you a second to adjust to talking to an upside-down boss, but here is Dirk Hammer on an inversion table when you arrive at his office for what was billed as a “quick strategy session”.

“I'm pleased to hear the Board liked the new AsciiDoc formatting in the README,” you say.

“They sure did.
This morning, I sent off a tweet at 4 a.m. with Ascii Docs markup in it.
Twitter didn't show it properly, but I got two likes and a retweet.”

“That's terrific, sir,” you say.

“Unfortunately, the retweeter had second thoughts later on and retracted the RT.”

“That's most unfortunate.
Maybe it'll stick next time.”

“Maybe,” responded Dirk Hammer, blood swelling his cranium, his untanned eyelids pinking up like little boiled tomato rinds.
“Anyway, that's not what I called you in for, friend.
Today I want to talk about the product space.
You sure seem to know some things about technical documentation.

“Now, I know you're itching to hack up some kind of fancy DocOps toolchain, like you hotshot DocOps people are always doing.
But before you go off half cocked, I want you to look into what's out there already from vendors in the product-documentation platform space.”

“To tell you the truth,” you say, “I was hoping I could use CRE -- CREP -- er, our product to, you know, document our product.”
You point out to your inverted boss that the product “even has ‘Recursive’ in the name.”

Without warning, Dirk's inversion table flips over and he is suddenly sprung upright, like Hannibal Lecter strapped to the hand-truck gurney, yet somehow more menacing as his face returns to its normal, unnatural hue.
“Excuse me, but do you have a Computer Science degree from Stanford or a comparable if less-renowned school?”

“No,” you admit.

“And are you the Acting Product Manager at Codexio?”

You shake your head, even as you're beginning to wonder about that one.

“Well then, how about we let _me_ decide what ‘recursive’ means in this context.”

“What _does_ ‘recursive’ mean in the context of our product?” you ask sincerely.

“That's not important right now,” Hammer says, reaching for his personal smoothie shaker.
“At the end of the day, we can't use our own product to make our own product.
That would be a perpetual-motion machine, and those are impossible.
I was a physics major before I transferred to CS.”

“Of course you were, sir.”

“Point is, we need a great docs platform if we're going to get our product docs off to a good start.
We don't really have much of a product built yet.
It's still mostly wireframes and a Launchrock page.”

“I see.”

“So why don't you get out there and see if there's a system that will be flexible enough for our needs, which is documenting the most tremendous documentation system ever made.”

Your brow furrows reflexively, but you choose your battles.
“So by ‘talk about strategy’, you meant _have me write about our competitors_?”

“Pretty much, yup.”

// tag::assignment[]
With apologies if you're just as disappointed with this exercise as your fictitious avatar is, but tooling is critical to DocOps.
Start digging around the technical documentation platform space to see what kinds of tools are out there.

Add an “Alternatives” section or subsection to your README, listing at least a few platforms, noting their strengths.
You can find suggestions in <<hosted-documentation-platforms>>.
