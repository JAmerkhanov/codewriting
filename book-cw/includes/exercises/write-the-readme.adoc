.Write the README
****
“Any good coding project starts with good documentation,” says Dirk Hammer, Codexio's rock-jawed CTO.
“But here at Codexio, that's doubly true, wouldn't you say?”

You nod in agreement, thrilled to finally have a gig where the docs will come first.

“So where do you think any good software project starts?” Hammer asks, his eyes squinting in indication that your answer will be graded.

You think the query over like it's a riddle.
You seemed to be saying all the right things during the interviews, but now the pressure is really on you to execute.
Say something clever, dammit!

“How about in the README file, Dirk?” you finally stammer.

“It's ‘Hammer’,” your new boss snaps, correcting you as if adjusting his tie, “or ‘Mr. Hammer’ if you prefer.”
The CTO's sense of formality catches you off guard, but you recover quickly.
After all, it's 2017; these are strange times.

Just when you think you've offended the company's number two guy, Hammer reaches out and pats you on the shoulder, suddenly grinning ear to ear.
“Indeed, any good software project starts with the README,” Hammer says, adding, “Great answer, you,” a line delivered such that you realize he's forgotten your name.

“I'd love to see our README, uh, Mr. Hammer, sir?” you manage.

“Why, that sounds like a document to me,” Hammer says.
That toothy used-car smile is back.
“Our README has to be the best README of them all.
But we're a lean machine here at Codexio, so you can start by just outlining our project.
Have it on my desk by Tuesday.”

Assignment::

--
// tag::assignment[]
Create a basic outline for the README introducing an open source documentation platform.

Somewhere on your filesystem, make a new directory for the product.
Put a file in it called `README.md`, and use Markdown notation to create at least the category headings you think any good README should have.

The Codexio founders haven't given you much to work with;
you may have to use your own ingenuity about product direction if you want anything beyond a generic outline.
