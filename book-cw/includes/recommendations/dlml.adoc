_All else being equal…_, my choice for lightweight markup language would definitely be AsciiDoc.
Markdown is widely known, but only because there's not much to learn… or do, strictly using Markdown.
Having to add HTML tags to your lightweight markup very much defeats the purpose of using an LML.

AsciiDoc is mostly elegant, with some exceptions.
For instance, I think its conditional logic could be handled much better, and it is in dire need of looping functionality.
These are places

More importantly, it empowers you with variables, conditionals, includes, and numerous other programmatic features.
AsciiDoc will also impress engineers rather than frighten them, whatever you've been taught to expect.

To try AsciiDoc syntax, I recommend link:http://asciidocfx.com[downloading AsciidocFX], an IDE specially designed for writing in AsciiDoc.
I use Atom for my day-to-day use, but AsciidocFX has better live preview and far better in-context help.
Their onboard AsciiDoc Cheat Sheet is a great place to start tinkering.

I do not recommend using the link:http://asciidoclive.com[AsciiDoc Live] website; their suggested syntax does not show off AsciiDoc's best markup alternatives.
