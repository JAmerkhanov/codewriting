_All else being equalâ€¦_, Atom is the most reliable code editor with advanced AsciiDoc features.
This recommendation comes with some bias, as I have not spent a lot of time with the alternatives.

When I recommended AsciiDoc as LML of choice, I suggested using AsciidocFX for learning.
Though AFX is a decent editor, and it is superior at rendering AsciiDoc live in the preview panel, I have not found it to be stable enough for my needs.
AFX lacks a lot of the features I expect in a mature code editor, which I find frustrating, possibly because I'm old and intolerant.
Version 1.5 is a big leap ahead for AFX, and I look forward to using it increasingly as it improves.

But Atom is a tried-and-true example of an IDE that offers great extensibility without being overly complicated.
There are hundreds of great packages for extending Atom, including several pertinent to AsciiDoc, Markdown, reStructuredText, and writing/text more generally.
