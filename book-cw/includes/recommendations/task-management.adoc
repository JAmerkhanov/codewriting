_All else being equalâ€¦_, I love GitHub Issues. It's simple and boasts minimal features, but it works, and it's in the right place, with full integration with your repo.

If you don't need an elaborate solution for large team and you don't already have one in place -- both big __if__s, I'm aware -- GitHub's Issues facility is simple to configure and learn, so you'll be up and running pretty much the moment you create your repo.
