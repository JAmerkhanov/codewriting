= Part Three: Delivering

[partintro]
--
Formerly called "publishing", the act of getting your technical content in front of readers' eyes involves much more than dumping it somewhere they can find it.
Our readers don't line up outside Barnes & Noble.
For technical docs, delivery means meeting the user where they are, when they need us, and frankly staying out of their way the rest of the time.
Delivery also refers to the next step in our implementation journey; in Part Three, we're delivering the beginnings of a content platform, either to ourselves or our team.
