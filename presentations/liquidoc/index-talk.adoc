== Welcome

* Brian Dominick, Technical Documentation Manager, Rocana

=== My Situation

* I work on a small engineering team with limited resources.

* Our devs are pretty hardcore when it comes to tools and techniques.

* I need SMEs to directly maintain reference matter about the product.

* We think like engineers about _everything_.

== What is Complex Content?

* Discrete, arrayed reference objects made up of key-value pairs, or collections of such pairs.

* What DITA handles as “reference” topics.

*Example: Glossary*

AsciiDoc::
  An extensible lightweight markup language with numerous powerful features such as conditional processing, file includes, and variable text substitutions.

Markdown::
  One of the lightest weight and most popular textual markup languages, popularized on GitHub, StackOverflow, various forums and comments systems, and numerous other places.
  Markdown, however, is not a dynamic language.

== Keys Begone

Stored as key-value pairs, but not necessarily displayed that way.

*Example: Bibliography*

== Real Complexity

*save.path.default* +
Establishes the default path to which the product saves files.

m| false

save.path.default = /tmp/product-output

== Solution Requirements

* Provides a single source of truth, internally (engineers and stakeholders) and externally (user-facing).

* Output to _anything_: source content should parse to any other format: HTML, XML, PDF, JSON.

* Kept in distributed source control.

* Aligned with product versions.

* Content (data) must be structured enough for manipulation and “querying”.

== Why Not a Relational Database?

* RDBs lack source control features.

* RDBs require schemas, and we need more flexibility.

* RDBs require complicated common interfaces & admin.

== Why Not DITA?

* Proprietary tooling is a non-starter for many engineers.

* DITA tools are expensive and closed.

* XML is for machines. We're people.

== Why Flat Files, FOSS, & Markup

* Whole team can collaborate on a central data source, inside the main product repo.

* Data uses the same source and version control as product it documents.

* Flexible as all get-out.

* Contributors can work using their favorite coding tools, which they're in anyway.

== Solution: LiquiDoc

A simple Ruby script that precompiles data into content source for further compiling into docs or interfaces.

----
$ liquidoc -d biblio.yml -t biblio.asciidoc -o biblio.adoc
----

* Give LiquiDoc a data file (YAML, JSON, XML, CSV) and a template file (Liquid) for mapping data to variables.

* LiquiDoc outputs flat files in any format, so your build tooling can use it as compiled source.

== Source File (YAML)

.biblio.yml
image::biblio_yml.png[]

== Parser Template (Liquid)

.biblio.asciidoc
image::biblio_liquid.png[]

== Output (AsciiDoc)

.biblio.adoc
image::biblio_adoc.png[]

== Built to HTML

=== Inline Tooltip

== Output (JSON)

.biblio.json
image::biblio_json.png[]

== Output (XML)

.biblio.json
image::biblio_xml.png[]

== Where To?

* Application UI elements drawn from single source:
** inline help
** form labels

* In the docs:
** inline tooltips
** elegant, structured content reuse
*** grouped by type here, alphabetical there
*** reshape to page or purpose
